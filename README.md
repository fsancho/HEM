# About the Model: Hybrid agent-based modeling and simulation on emergency situations.

This is a "Hybrid agent-based modeling and simulation on emergency situations" for NetLogo.

Is very important to keep the structure of nodes and edges files. And they must be specified in the main screen.

Netlogo will generate the graph by reading this CSV files in the set-up step, and once the graph is created, and the parameters fixed we can run the simulation.

You can find other utilities in the extras folder, such as a preprocess-CSV script in Python (the only one right now, but there will be more in the future), and the model `social_forces.nlogo`, that is an adapted implementation of the work made by Dirk Helbing and Péter Molnár in https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282
